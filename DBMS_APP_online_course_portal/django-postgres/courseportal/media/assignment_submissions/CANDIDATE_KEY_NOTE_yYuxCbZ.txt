R = (A, B, C, G, H, I)
F = {A -> B, A -> C, CG -> H, CG -> I, B -> H}

result=A
result=AB{A->B AND ASUBSET OF RESULT}
result = ABC{A->C AND A SUBSET OF AB / RESULT}
result=ABCH{B->H AND B IS SUBSET OF ABC / RESULT}

SO A+ -> R WRONG
result=G 
SO G+->R WRONG 
HENCE,
AG IS MINIMUM SO ITS A CANDIDATE KEY



CG-> HI HOLDS???

result=CG
result=CGH{CG->H AND CG IS SUBSET OF RESULT}
result = CGHI{CG->I AND CG IS SUBSET OF RESULT }

HI IS SUBSET OF CGHI (TRUE)

HENCE RULE IS CORRECT(UNION)


EITHER APPLY TRANSITIVITY AND RULES ND CHECK ELSE CHECK WITH THE ABOVE CONDITION.

SUPERKEY CAN HAVE REDUNDANT ATTR




CONICAL:
R = (A, B, C)
F = {A -> BC}
{B -> C}
{A -> B}
{AB -> C}


{ALPHA - A}+

AB-A=B+

RESULT=B
RESULT=BC

C NEEDS TO BE SUBSET OF RESULT AND YES SO ITS REDUNDENT SO DONT REQUIRE "A"

SO, {A->BC,B->C,B->C} SO REMOVE ONE {B-C} DUPLICATE

SO {A->BC,B->C}

F PRIME (F')={A->B B->C}

RESULT = A
RESULT =AB
RESULT = ABC

C IS SUBSET OF RESULT  SO F' BECOMES F'C
